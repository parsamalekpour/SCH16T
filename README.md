SCH16T Sensor Hardware & STM32 Example

This repository contains hardware design files (schematic + PCB) and example firmware for running the SCH16T sensor with an STM32 microcontroller.
🛠️ Hardware
	•	Designed with [your EDA tool, e.g., KiCad/Altium/Eagle]
	•	Includes schematic + PCB for integrating the SCH16T sensor
	•	Ready-to-fabricate Gerber files

💻 Firmware Example
	•	Example STM32 project built with STM32CubeIDE / Keil / PlatformIO
	•	Demonstrates how to:
	•	Initialize the SCH16T sensor
	•	Read data via [I²C / SPI / UART — specify your interface]
	•	Process and display sensor values

🚀 Getting Started

Hardware
	1.	Manufacture the PCB using the provided Gerber files.
	2.	Assemble with SCH16T and required components.
	3.	Connect to your STM32 board.

Firmware
	1.	Open the firmware/stm32_example project in STM32CubeIDE (or your preferred IDE).
	2.	Flash the code to your STM32 board.
	3.	Open a serial terminal to view sensor readings.
